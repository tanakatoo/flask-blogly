If we seed data using the csv, does flask know to where to start the auto-increment id? It doesn't look like it knows, and
when start adding using the app, it says the id is duplicated. What is a good way to add lots of seed data?

Edit page - if we press "reset", and want to populate with the original info, how do we get this from the form? 
(the values attribute that we set from the jinja template?)

How do we separate the route from the models? 
Can we put all calls to the db (queries, adding, deleting data) be inside the model? 
Colt doesn't do that. App.py should only define routes and anything related to the db should be done in models.py?

Check my User Details page. 2 routes, 2 forms? Each route needs a form?

When do we use class methods and when do we use normal methods?
we are introduced to @property
what others are there that we should know?

testing:
doesn't run in flask
trying to setup in vscode, sometimes it runs sometimes it doesn't
